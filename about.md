# Using XPLOIT Safely

XPLOIT is a large platform with many apps, so it is hard to moderate all the content on the platform.

XPLOIT is committed to safety and you can read our privacy policy [here](https://xploit.cosmixcom.repl.co/apps/legal/privacy.html)

### Verified Apps

To Keep you safe, XPLOIT official products will have a verified badge like this. If I product displays this badge on the official XPLOIT app store, then it is safe to use.


Downloading apps cannot give you viruses or steal information from your computer. However, they can make fake login screens like Google or Amazon which can steal your information.

ONLY trust login screens on official XPLOIT apps.

If you encounter a malicous XPLOIT app, please report it at https://report.zymono.com/xploit.

### XPLOIT Chat

To protect users safety and privacy, XPLOIT chat hides your name, email and photo. The only identification is a user id. Because of this, it is easy to send content deemed innapropriate via this system. Any content of this matter will result in an account ban. You can report malicous behavior at https://report.zymono.com/xploit.

### Note to School Admins and HR Departments

XPLOIT will not disclose any user information including but not limited to passwords, emails, names, identifications, and images under any circumstance unless obligated by law enforcement, regulatory agencies, or in court trials.
